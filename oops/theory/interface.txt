- All variables inside interface are public, static, final
- All methods inside interface are public abstract (no method body)
- A interface can have default and static method (contains method body)
- A interface cannot be instantiated
- default method should be public/(default), and it can be overridden
- to access variables, static method use.. (InterfaceName.variable/method)
_____________________________________________________________________________________

- A interface can extends multiple interfaces
- A class can extends only one class
- A class can implements multiple interfaces
- A class can extends a class and implements interfaces in respective order
- A class implementing interface should implement all the methods in interface
  else, the class should be abstract.
- Overriding method visibility should not reduced.
