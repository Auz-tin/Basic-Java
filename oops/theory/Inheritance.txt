1.	IS – A relationship
2.	Performed by extends keyword
3.	(Child class/derived class/ subclass) extends (Parent class/base class/ superclass)
4.	Object class is root class/ super class for every java class
	11 methods available in Object class which is under (java.lang.Object)

TYPES OF INHERITANCE
•	Single inheritance			A->B
•	Multi-level inheritance			A->B->C
•	Hierarchical inheritance		A->B , A->C
•	Multiple inheritance
  	NOT SUPPORTED IN JAVA due to ambiguity 	A,B->C
  	if both A and B has methods of same names which method the child will inherit?


OBJECT CREATION
1.ParentClass a = new ParentClass();
    parent class members called (no overriding)
    
2.ChildClass b = new ChildClass();
    Parent class + Child class members + Child class overriding
    
3.ParentClass c = new ChildClass(); // upcasting
    Parent class members + Child class overriding
    Child class cannot be referenced to hold parent class object
    
4.ChildClass d = ( ChildClass) c;   // downcasting
    Parent class + Child class members + Child class overriding

CONSTRUCTOR CHAINING:
If object created for subclass, super class non-parametrised constructor is called first
then sub class non-parametrised constructor is called.

RULES:
1. If there is constructor, there should be a non-parametrised constructor.
2. Parentclass should not be final.
3. overriding method should not be final.
4. overriding method visibility cannot be reduced
5. overriding method should not be static.
