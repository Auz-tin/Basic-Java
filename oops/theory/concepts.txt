FOUR PILLARS OF OOP

ABSTRACTION:
- Abstraction is a process where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details/ complexities.
- is design or interface level.
- focus on what should be done
- shows client what it can do rather how
- In java Abstract class is partial Abstraction
          Interface is 100% Abstraction

ENCAPSULATION: 
- Encapsulation hides implementation details/ internal working of the class
- Encapsulation simply means binding object state(fields) and behaviour(methods) together.
- is mplementation level.
- focus on how should be done
- prevent outsiders access it directly.
- In java, every class is encapsulated (binding variables and methods) done by private, protected and public
  If every data member is private, then it is called as Tightly encapsulated class

POLYMORPHISM:
- Provides different functionality based on
  1. data (overloading)
  2. object (overriding)
  
HIERARHY:

- generalization (inheritance) (is-a , type-of)
- association (aggregation, composition) (has-a, part-of, whole-part)
